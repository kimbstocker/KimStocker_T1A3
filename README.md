#Software Development Plan
##Purpose
- describe at a high level what the application will do
- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
##Scope
- identify the target audience
- explain how a member of the target audience will use it
##Features
describe
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling

###Feature 2:
###Feature 3:


##User Interaction and User Experience
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user


##Control Flow Diagram
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.


##Software Developement Plan and Implementation
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item
-  Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.
